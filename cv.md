My name is _**Aleksey Rogach**_. Now I am working as a content manager/web-editor at Samara University.
I would like to become a front-end developer. I wish to get the necessary knowledge in order to further apply for the position of junior web-developer. Development attracts me because, unlike the current work of the content manager, it allows not just maintaining the site, but creating it. It is much more complicated, but there is much more creativity. In addition, to create not just modern, but convenient sites with an accessible interfaces- means to benefit society.

## Skills
At the basic level I own HTML 5/CSS3, a bit familiar with —Å JS, less preprocessor In 2019 and 2020 took two intensive courses *in HTML and CSS* (from **HTML Academy**). The first was devoted to the study of the basic techniques of professional website layout, the second taught how to create adaptive websites using automation tools.
After that, I made some simple landing pages using psd and figma layouts to consolidate my knowledge.
At my current job, I was **studying English** under the program of *the University of Oxford*. The current level of language proficiency is **A2**.
